From .Net to Java development, or consultancy/presales for Oracle, setting up ESXi servers, living on the edge in startup scene to the whole new DevOps thing, I've been in a number of roles in IT businesses all trying to build the next biggest thing.

The one thing that has never failed to get me excited to wake up in the morning, be it in the warm, humid, instant sweaty clothes, tropical weather in south east Asia or the cold, feet numbing winter mornings in the eastern beaches of Australia, has been learning something new. By learning, I don't always mean learning how to write random utilities to automate something really annoying with the latest, shiniest language, or deploying nginx containers with some container orchestrator, but sometimes learning something that another person has managed to master that I could take away a few key points from which I might not be able to afford to do in my own life time. 

I'm not going to lie, its not a joy ride all the time. There are lots of good people, good projects, cool technologies and lots of fun moments, but then there are days, people and projects that make you wish the Vogons would build that bypass IRL.

While days in the life of a (insert the newest title for a software engineer) could be fairly mundane at times, for some reason I like to take on challenges that would otherwise be unlikely to be taken on by someone like myself. Be it running an ultra-marathon (100k), twice, or deciding to accept a project that an entire team failed to deliver with an insane amount of wasted budget. I can say that I enjoy being in situations that have pushed me to new limits.

So there, this might be the highlights of my conversation starters with people. If you're keen to talk about any of the subjects that I brought up, or something that you've learned that you are willing to share with someone else, I'm up for it. Hit me up at hndanesh@gmail.com
